# BMP280 Example

This example builds upon the Adafruit `bmp280test` example, changing a few features to work with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Here is a standard BMP280 breakout board. The actual BMP280 sensor itself is the small silver component in the centre of the board. This uses the small hole to calculate the air pressure so be careful to not touch the sensor and keep it clean.
